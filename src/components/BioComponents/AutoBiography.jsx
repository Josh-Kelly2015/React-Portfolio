  <p>
    Hey there! Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Joshua Kelly. As a
    recent graduate of Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp
    Program, web development has completely taken over my life. Keeping up with
    trends and constantly changing technologies has certainly become a
    lifestyle. Honestly tho, if it were any different, then I wouldn't want it.
    This industry embodies creativity and imagination at its finest. There's
    always an undying push to innovate, intense competition to be the best, and
    infinite potential to change the world. I feel blessed to have finally found
    an outlet to make my mark in history.
